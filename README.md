# Python-Web-Scraper

This is a Web Scraper that I made that Logs into Doc martens website and checks whether Jamie Leather Chelsea boots are available in Size 8
 If yes, It sends me an email using stdlib. 
 I'm planning to develop this app further and make it Gui to search for all kind of products
 
 used unittest python framework to test my code
